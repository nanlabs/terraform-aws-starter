## Motivation

The Terraform AWS Starter Kit solves the most challenging aspect of AWS infrastructure building by providing a powerful solution for our clients. Our goal is to simplify the process of setting up a reliable and scalable AWS environment, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications swiftly and confidently.

## Key Features

### Secure State Management üîí

The Terraform AWS Starter Kit includes secure state management configurations. Your Terraform state is stored in an S3 bucket with a DynamoDB table for state locking. This ensures the security of your infrastructure's state and facilitates easy management and sharing among team members.

### Scalable VPC Configuration üåê

Our starter kit provisions a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets across three availability zones. This scalable VPC configuration enables the segregation of application and database resources, providing high availability for your infrastructure components.

### Enhanced Security üîê

The starter kit implements security groups for the bastion host and database instances, ensuring controlled access to your resources. The bastion host allows secure access to private resources within the VPC, providing an additional layer of security.

### Database Provisioning üóÉÔ∏è

We have included configurations to provision an RDS PostgreSQL instance, RDS Aurora cluster, MSK cluster, MongoDB Atlas cluster, and more. These configurations enable you to set up and manage your databases with ease, ensuring optimal performance and reliability for your applications.

### Kubernetes Cluster Provisioning üö¢

Our starter kit includes configurations to provision an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. This enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications using Kubernetes, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of AWS for your workloads.

### Secrets Management üîë

The Terraform AWS Starter Kit integrates with AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage your database credentials. This ensures that sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, is not exposed in your Terraform code or version control system.

### Parameter Management üîß

Our starter kit leverages AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store to store and manage various parameters required for your infrastructure, such as VPC ID, subnet IDs, and other configuration details. This centralizes the management of configuration parameters, making it easier to update and maintain your infrastructure as it evolves.

### GitHub Actions Integration üöÄ

We have preconfigured GitHub Actions workflows that provide linting, security checks, and more for your Terraform code. This integration enables automated checks and validation, ensuring adherence to coding standards and identifying potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process.

- Pull Request validation with [Danger](https://danger.systems/js), markdown linting, and more! ‚úÖ
- Linter validation with [Super-Linter](https://github.com/super-linter/super-linter)! üìù
- Terraform Format validation with [Terraform Fmt](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/fmt.html). üîÑ
- Terraform Security validation with [Terraform Security](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec). üîí
- Terraform Docs update with [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/). üìù
- TODOs to GitHub Issues with [TODOs to Issues](https://github.com/alstr/todo-to-issue-action). üìå

By using the Terraform AWS Starter Kit, you can expedite the initial setup of your AWS infrastructure while incorporating proven best practices. It empowers you to focus on building and deploying your applications while providing a solid foundation for scalability, security, and maintainability.

We welcome contributions and feedback to improve this starter kit further, making it a valuable resource for the community.

## Quick Start

To get started, explore the available modules and scripts, and follow the instructions provided in their respective README files. For a more hands-on introduction, you can start with the examples provided in the [**Live Infrastructure**](#live-infrastructure) and [**Infra Tools and Scripts**](#infra-tools-and-scripts) sections.

## Live Infrastructure

The `live` directory houses our active infrastructure configurations. These configurations are organized by domain, allowing you to manage different parts of your infrastructure separately.

## Infra Tools and Scripts

This section contains additional tools and scripts that complement our Terraform modules, helping you manage specific tasks.

**What tools and scripts are available?**

- Bastion Host Connection script: Connect to an AWS Bastion host securely.
- Generate `kubeconfig` script: Generate a `kubeconfig` file for an EKS Cluster.
- Tunnel to EKS Cluster script: Create a tunnel to an EKS Cluster for `kubectl` access.
- and more!

Refer to the [Infra Tools and Scripts README](./scripts/README.md) for more details and usage examples!

## Best practices

- We recommend using automated code scanning tools to improve security and quality of the code. This pattern was scanned using [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/) - a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code. It scans cloud infrastructure code defined using Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Helm, ARM Templates and Serverless framework platforms and detects security and compliance misconfigurations.
- Additionally, we recommend at minimum to perform basic validation and formatting checks using `terraform validate` and `terraform fmt -check -recursive` Terraform commands.
- It‚Äôs a good practice to add automated tests for infrastructure code. You can refer to this Terraform Blog post to learn more about different approaches to testing Terraform code.
